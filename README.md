# UserFinder

With this project, I want to demonstrate the acquired skills of next.js, typescript and tailwindcss.

The project is a simple person finder that offers the possibility of having many details of the person sought.

The API'S that I used to practice was taken from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/
